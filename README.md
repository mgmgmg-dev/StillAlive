2. **Clone** the repository.
3. **Open** a **command prompt or** a **powershell** window in the repository's folder.
4. Type `python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel & python3 -m pip install playsound` and hit enter.

## How to run
1. **Open** a **command prompt or** a **powershell** window in the repository's folder.

## Help, I'm on a unix-based system
You need to install python for your system and install the `playsound` library, then run `main.py` with that python installation.

> ***WARNING:*** If you've got a fresh installation, you will most likely encounter an error while building `wheel`. To resolve this error, make sure to have installed the latest version of the `setuptools` and `wheel` libraries.
